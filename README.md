# jOOXBloggExample
An example project described in my blog-post. Shows a couple of ways to use jOOX to parse and manipulate XML.

The example is made in a junit-test and writes the resulting xml to system-out.
This is done so that the lazy user can test it out by writing "mvn test" in the "jooxexamples" directory and see the result without importing any code to any IDE.

The code and xml is only two files and can be viewed in the src/main/resources and src/test/java directories.

I have also checked in a setup for IntelliJ and the pom also has support for generating Eclipse-projects.

If you use Eclipse, do an "mvn eclipse:eclipse install" to set it all up and then import the project in Eclipse.

Enjoy!
